  <p>Application programming interfaces, or simply APIs, are built on the idea of the Seperation of concerns which means the splitting of a program into multiple parts with each one handling a single task. They are the primary reason why you&rsquo;re able to write a GUI or a Graphical user interface for your program without having to worry about implementing the low-level graphics functionality yourself, instead, you can focus on developing the actual program. This type of API is called a Local API, Local APIs do not require remote access because they are stored locally on your machine, other examples of Local APIs include programming libraries, local database access APIs, input/output or I/O APIs etc&#8230;.</p>

  <p>In my previous article I talked about Thread libraries, these libraries fall under the local API category and are very important as writing those libraries yourself would require a lot of time and effort. A different category of APIs are Remote APIs, remote APIs aren&rsquo;t stored locally, instead they are either on a server or another computer, whenever your program tries accessing content on a webserver for example, it uses a remote API.</p>

  <p>An API can be thought of as the intermediary between programs in the same way that a graphical user interface is the intermediary between users of a program and its underlying code. Much like a user isn&rsquo;t required to have any knowledge of coding to listen to their favorite songs on spotify, a weather app can use API data supplied by a weather data provider without having to know anything about that provider&rsquo;s code, APIs therefore hide complexity while at the same time allowing information to be exchanged.</p>

  <p>API calls are either synchronous or asynchronous, the distinction between the two is that synchronous API calls allow for a single API call at a time, while the asynchronous ones allow for multiple calls at a time, an app using an API provided by a another app can either initiate a single request, wait for a response to arrive, then send another request in which case it is using synchronous API calls, or initiate multiple requests each of them handled by a seperate thread, these would be asynchronous API calls. Asynchronous API calls take advantage of Multithreading which I talked about in my previous article, the choice of synchrounous versus asynchrounous API calls depends on the type of requested data and wether multiple requests depend on each other or not.</p>

  <p>As the internet grew larger and larger, remote APIs became an integral part of it, and with that came security problems, DDoS or Distributed denial of service attacks, SQL injections and broken authentication are some of the security attacks that take advantage of the vulnerabilities in an API implementation, because of the nature of how APIs work, a bad actor can intercept an API call in either its request or response phase and aquire the contained data. APIs implementing authentication through Static strings are vulnerable to packet sniffers which are programs that monitor and log traffic within a network, bad actors may then analyse that traffic for static strings to extract authentication keys such as usernames, email addresses and passwords. This would be categorized as a broken authentication attack because the attacker breaks into the system by assuming an authorized identity. Any network is vulnerable to DDoS attacks as this type of attack unlike the previous one is not about gaining access to a system but rendering the whole system inaccessible, its simplest version: DoS attacks work by flooding the server with traffic from a single machine with the goal of exhausting the server&rsquo;s resources to the point where no more traffic can pass through, DDoS attacks are DoS attacks on steroids, an army of machines controlled by either bots or humans all launch multiple DoS attacks, both DoS and DDoS attacks may result in a website or webserver becoming inaccessible. SQL is a database query language, an SQL injection is when an attacker takes advantage of unsanitized input, an SQL injection is possible in cases where a user is expected to submit input but the backend isn&rsquo;t protected against unsafe input, the attacker in this situation can submit input in the form of sql code which may lead to database vulnerabilities in the case of an unprotected backend. API vulnerabilities can be found mostly in public APIs because anyone can access them, private and partnered APIs are less vulnerable and therefore safer as they require limited authorization to either machines within the company itself, or within a trusted partner company.</p>

  <p>Local APIs are straightforward and don&rsquo;t require security control for the part, if there is any security control however, its purpose is likely to protect the API from itself, for example: in the case of thread-safety. But when it comes to remote APIs, safety becomes first priority, and to provide that security there are a number of techniques: Rate limiting is limiting the number of requests that an API can receive, its main purpose is to avoid Denial of service attacks, however, other applications for rate limiting may include lowering the traffic rate so that the API remains accessible to users, if an API receives more requests than it can handle, it may crash, or slow down. Another way to avoid crashing the API in the case of an overflow of traffic, is to use throttling, throttling is controlling the frequency of a particular operation such as a function call, if a function is slow, throttling it may improve an API&rsquo;s overall performance. Data encryption is a fundamental security principle, APIs that interact with a database of sensitive information should do their best to keep data encrypted at all delivery stages: using HTTPS instead of HTTP for starters. APIs should be rigorously tested, in this way security flaws are identified and fixed, releasing public APIs without thorough testing may result in vulnerabilities that not only compromise user privacy, but the servers themselves may be hacked or taken down depending on the vulnerabilities in question and the magnitude of the attacks.</p>

  <p>When it comes to APIs two names are often mentioned: SOAP (or simple object access protocol) and REST (or representational state transfer), the differences between the two are that SOAP is a protocol while REST is an architectural style, SOAP adds more overhead and requires more resources because of its focus on security and low-level handling, while REST is lightweight because security implementation is put on the shoulder of the developer and it provides a level of abstraction higher than that of SOAP which makes it both lightweight and easy to use, SOAP, because of its security features is more fit for industry level APIs like banking APIs while REST is more fit for web services where the level of security depends on the type of data.</p>

  <p>The parties in an API interaction are called endpoints, accessing those endpoints is done through the API, an API gateway is the intermediary between a client&rsquo;s API request and the endpoint on the other side, API gateways are used for security, protocol translation, performance improvements and a host of other features that improve user and developer experience, gateways are also useful for commercial APIs, managing and billing users of an API is easier done in the gateway level than inside each API endpoint.</p>
